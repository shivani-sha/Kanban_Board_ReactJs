# **Kanban Board Application**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a popular toolchain for setting up React projects quickly and efficiently.

---

## **Available Scripts**

In the project directory, you can run:

### **`npm start`**
- Starts the development server and runs the app in development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.
- The page reloads automatically when you make changes to the code.
- Any lint errors will appear in the console.

---

### **`npm test`**
- Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- For more information, refer to the [Running Tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/) section of the Create React App documentation.

---

### **`npm run build`**
- Builds the app for production, optimizing it for the best performance.
- Outputs a production-ready version of your app to the `build` folder.
  - The build is minified, and filenames include unique hashes.
  - Your app will be ready for deployment.

For additional details, visit the [Deployment Guide](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/).

---

### **`npm run eject`**

> **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot undo this step.

- **What it Does**:
  - Removes the single build dependency (`react-scripts`) from your project.
  - Copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (e.g., Webpack, Babel, ESLint) directly into your project.
  - Provides full control over the configuration, allowing you to modify it as needed.

- **Post-Ejection**:
  - All existing commands (except `eject`) will still work.
  - However, they will now reference the copied scripts instead of the original `react-scripts` package.

- **Recommendation**:
  - Ejecting is rarely necessary and is only recommended if you require significant customization of the configuration (e.g., for advanced Webpack modifications).
  - Consider alternative approaches like creating a custom Webpack configuration or using tools like [Craco](https://github.com/dilanx/craco) before resorting to ejecting.
